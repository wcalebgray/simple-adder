# Four Bit Ripple Carry Adder

A simple model representing the physical implementation of a 4-bit ripple carry adder

## Setup
1. Ensure Node 10 is being used
2. Run ```npm install```

## Run
Run ```node dist/index <int 1> <int 2>```
This should output a console log of the sum of the integers. It is assumed that these integers are in the range of 0-15.

## Test
To run the test suite, run ```npm run test```
